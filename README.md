# 📜 Department of Attention Management (DAM) – Official Administrative Documentation

Welcome to the official repository of the **Department of Attention Management (DAM)**,  
proudly *"Serving the Public with Procedural Integrity Since 1974"*.

This repository contains the **entire bureaucratic framework** for professional collaboration requests,  
painstakingly engineered to maximize **form completion rates, procedural compliance, and comedic absurdity**.
